// play a game like war with four players each playing highest card and highest one wins

/**
‘War’ is very simple. 2 players are each dealt out half of a standard 52-card deck. The two then face off, flipping over their top card. Whoever has the highest card takes both cards. On the occasion that the cards have the same value, players risk the next 3 cards of their deck, and battle with the 4th card. Whoever plays the highest 4th card wins all of the cards in the pile (their own 3 cards plus the opponent’s 3 cards). The game ends when a player does not have any cards left.
